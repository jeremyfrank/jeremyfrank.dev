summary: Developing a campaign site for a new nationwide advertising campaign by the Ad Council.
---

Ad Council’s new Belonging Begins with Us campaign empowers viewers to foster a more welcoming nation where everyone, regardless of background, feels they belong. The goal for the campaign site was to present a rich and diverse “American tapestry” of stories and their accompanying objects.

My role on this project was to learn Ad Council’s existing CMS platform, then build and integrate the site using the its built-in templating and theming system.

## Interactive Prototyping

For the home page, my team and I wanted to do an interactive card grid with paning and zooming and smooth transitions to detail pages. I put together a series of prototypes which were used for vetting and confirming that this approach would work.

- [Prototype 1](https://codepen.io/jeremyfrank/pen/XWdMMQj) – Layout and card hovers using CSS Grid, Transforms
- [Prototype 2](https://codepen.io/jeremyfrank/pen/YzqVzJy) – Card transitions using the [FLIP](https://aerotwist.com/blog/flip-your-animations/) technique
- [Prototype 3](https://codepen.io/jeremyfrank/pen/mdPMwMo) – Pan & zoom using the [Panzoom](https://github.com/timmywil/panzoom) library

These prototypes were then combined to produce the finished interactive card grid.
