summary: Developing a campaign site for a new nationwide advertising campaign by the Ad Council.

Ad Council’s new Belonging Begins with Us campaign empowers viewers to foster a more welcoming nation where everyone, regardless of background, feels they belong. The goal for the campaign site was to present a rich and diverse “American tapestry” of stories and their accompanying objects.

My role on this project was to learn Ad Council’s existing CMS platform, then build and integrate the site using the its built-in theme system.
